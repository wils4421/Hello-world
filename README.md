# Hello-world
basic repository. maybe I'll come up with something to share.
I am happy today. It looks Like I just completed the Master of Science in Finance at the University of Utah. I did a little work in RStudio so this has given me a feeling that I may be able to learn how to program. Although, I just got into github to try get the randomizer that amazon uses in their weekly meetings.
